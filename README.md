# React Native Web Starter

Original Repo Link: https://github.com/joefazz/react-native-web-starter

## Introduction

This repo is intending to provide an easy starting point for developers looking to make fully cross platform applications across both web with [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) and mobile with [Expo](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can run `yarn web` in order to start up the development web server with all the hot reloading goodness you've come to expect.

It has then been integrated with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and running `yarn ios` or `yarn android` will start the Expo packager. You can also run the project from the Expo XDE program.

## React Router
This package allows you to set the page's components based on what the URL is. All you need to do is wrap the components by a `<Router>` tag and insert which components you want to modify using the `<Link>` tag.
 - Here is an example: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start/example-basic-routing
