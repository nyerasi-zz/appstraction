### How to Add Fonts!

- See if the font you need is available on [fontcdn.org](https://fontcdn.org/). If it is, just select which font styles you need and copy the `@import` statement into `public/fonts.css`
- If the font is not on that website, search the internet for the `eot, svg, ttf, woff, woff2` font filetypes (you can usually find them on GitHub), and place them in a new folder under `public/fonts/fontname`. Then, reference the files in `public/fonts.css`, as is done for Gotham :)
- To set a backup font in a `styles.js` file, you can try `fontFamily: "Gotham, sans-serif"`, where sans-serif is the backup font in case Gotham doesn't exist/work

# React Native Web Starter

Original Repo Link: https://github.com/joefazz/react-native-web-starter

## Introduction

This repo is intending to provide an easy starting point for developers looking to make fully cross platform applications across both web with [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) and mobile with [Expo](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can run `yarn web` in order to start up the development web server with all the hot reloading goodness you've come to expect.

It has then been integrated with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and running `yarn ios` or `yarn android` will start the Expo packager. You can also run the project from the Expo XDE program.

## React Router

This package allows you to set the page's components based on what the URL is. All you need to do is wrap the components by a `<Router>` tag and insert which components you want to modify using the `<Link>` tag.

- Here is an example: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start/example-basic-routing
